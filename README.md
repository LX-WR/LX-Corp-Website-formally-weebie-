# LX Corp website (formally weebie)
You've landed on LX's github repo, made just for his website!
Before you go on and ~~steal~~ *borrow* the code, letme tell u a little story...
## The long and short of it
Before this was made, and before I even knew what html even was, this was meant to be a test website for weebies. Specificly, [Index.html](https://pages.github.com/) and [links.html](https://pages.github.com/) were for the test.
After that, I saw the immensly powerful capabilites of HTML code, and so I decided to create my entire website, my personal website, and our partner's website - all running on a Raspberry Pi 5 :}
Soon, the defualt weebie pages will be replaced by more *formal* language, while still keeping some of that nice LX2023 slang that I enjoy :} The old pages will always be available - just type "old" infront of da "index.html" or "links.html" to see the old ones.
## Beginner's suggestions
I run my webserver on my Raspberry Pi 5 - 8GB ram, running the apache webserver package. You can grab it on debain-based linux distros pretty easily (ubuntu, etc). More detailed instructions to come.
## Is that all, LX2023?
No! You can enure that this website gets the help it needs by making commits! I, however, will be maintaining this website for as long as I see fit :} As of 2/11/25, the website is still in development, so there will be missing pages, and those will be fixed in the comming weeks. Farewell, traveler! :}
