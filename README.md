# LX Corp website (formally weebie)
You've landed on LX's github repo, made just for his website!
The REAL website is here: http://68.134.47.195:8080/index.html - that's hosted on a Rapsberry Pi 5 :}

Before you go on and ~~steal~~ *borrow* the code, letme tell u a little story...
## The long and short of it
Before this was made, and before I even knew what html even was, this was meant to be a test website for weebies. Specificly, [Index.html]([https://pages.github.com/](https://github.com/LX-WR/LX-Corp-Website-formally-weebie-/blob/main/index.html)) and [links.html]([https://pages.github.com/](https://github.com/LX-WR/LX-Corp-Website-formally-weebie-/blob/main/links.html)) were for the test (remember - u still must download da stylesheet and da images for it to look right!).
After that, I saw the immensly powerful capabilites of HTML code, and so I decided to create my entire website, my personal website, and our partner's website - all running on a Raspberry Pi 5 :}
Soon, the defualt weebie pages will be replaced by more *formal* language, while still keeping some of that nice LX2023 slang that I enjoy :} The old pages will always be available - just type "old" infront of da "[index.html]([https://pages.github.com/](https://github.com/LX-WR/LX-Corp-Website-formally-weebie-/blob/main/index.html))" or "[links.html]([https://pages.github.com/](https://github.com/LX-WR/LX-Corp-Website-formally-weebie-/blob/main/links.html))" to see the old ones.
## Beginner's suggestions
I run my webserver on my Raspberry Pi 5 - 8GB ram, running the apache webserver package. You can grab it on debain-based linux distros pretty easily (ubuntu, etc). More detailed instructions to come. Do keep in mind that I've removed ALL images and backgrounds in the raw git, download the **.zip** archive if u want to have those too :}
## Is that all, LX2023?
No! You can enure that this website gets the help it needs by making commits! I, however, will be maintaining this website for as long as I see fit :} As of 2/15/25, the website is still in development, so there will be missing pages, and those will be fixed in the comming weeks. Farewell, traveler! :}
