<h3>Frequently Asked Questions?</h3>
<div class="rounded-box animate-box">
<h2>Q1: why does this site look - wierd? Is it a scam site?</h2>
<p>Answer 1: No, this is NOT a scam site, but it's in active development (by only 1 person!), so it may have the occasional bug, glitch, and etc. If something looks VERY funny, however, you should try <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+clear+my+borwser%27s+cache&oq=how+to+clear+my+borwser%27s+cache&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOdIBCDk0MjhqMGo3qAIAsAIA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8" target="_blank">clearing ur browser's cache.</a></p>

<h2>Q2: What was this website intended for?</h2>
<p>Answer 2: I originally made this website becuase I was curious about the capabilites of HTML compared to a website builder I was using known as wix.</p>
<p>Eventrually, i realized that it could function to be much more than a weebie example :} I then began to make this (very simple) framework, and i plan it to host my bissnuess website, my personal website, and my co-worker's website alltoghter on a raspberry pi 5 :}</p>
<h2>Q3: Why is it running so slowly?</h2>
<p>Answer 3: It's probably becuase of the blur effects, as they take a nice toll on lower-end devices :c to get rid of the blur, simply disable hardware acceleration in ur browser's settings (although it may not make it faster!) - I made a fix for it, but it DOES USE JAVASCRIPT + COOKIES. You'll find that button up top. If u don't want javascript, u can:</p>

  <button id="myButton9">Learn how to disable hardware acceleration...</button>
</a>
<h2>Q4: Why does the site lack important features (light/dark mode, etc)?</h2>
<p>Answer 4: This site (excluding embeds) currently lacks javascript, an essentail technology in web development. I did this due to the fact that javascript gets confusing FAST - and peeps think that it can introduce cookies and trackers (and it can!), so I've avoided my own javascript alltogether (execpt for the blurring toggle, it was a requirement :c)</p>
<h2>Q5: I want to contribute! How can I help with development or other projects?</h2>
<p> Answer 5: Let's make one thing REALLY clear, I don't want any money (yet, bwahahaha), so u can help me (and be a good, functioning part of da community :} by subscribing to my youtube channel, and joining da discord for new stuff :}</p>
